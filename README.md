# OpenLine CSM — Canon · Coach · Students (Receipts-Native)

**What this is**
A tiny, working “constraint surfer” with your Terrynce Curve built in.
- **Canon (law)**: Budget (Ic ≤ k·AMB), Bend (κ < κc), and a small Emergence benchmark.
- **Coach (style)**: proposes tiny, bounded nudges per lane (forgiveness, smoothing, VKD, reflex order).
- **Students**: any agent/model (a transparent simulator here).
- **Receipts**: every run emits a one-screen proof to GitHub Pages.

**Live page (after enabling Pages → main → /docs)**
`https://<you>.github.io/openline-csm/`

**How it runs**
A GitHub Action (`coach-run.yml`) executes the coach weekly or on demand, runs a shadow simulation, judges by Canon, and commits a **Tuning Receipt** (and new style if accepted).

**Mantra**
Shadow → Tuning Receipt → Live. **Law is global. Style is local.**
